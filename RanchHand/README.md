*VirtualDJ Database, Settings, Playlist, and Information Manager*

This folder is dedicated to the application known as the Ranch Hand which is
designed to manage the database (.xml) and related settings files used by VirtualDJ
software in order to appropriately manage sharing settings and configuration across
multiple personal computers.

*KRNC - Welcome Home.*

Ranch Hand utilizes both a user interface and Windows service to perform the actions
necessry to synchronize the settings across multiple machines. Ranch Hand requires a
shared cloud file service such as OneDrive or GoogleDrive with files stored locally
on the machine to manage appropriate synchronization.

Ranch Hand relies upon a file structure as shown below to manage files appropriately,
and as such, the installer will perform the folder construction that is required.

### Brief History
KRNC, a ficticious broadcast radio station is a radio station for everyone, it is
everyone's own station. "Your music lives here," the musical positioning statement
for the station.

The station call-letters (KRNC) are derived as follows:
 - K: The "West-Coast" signifier used by all radio stations west of the Mississippi River
 - RNC: The "prominent" and "leading" consonants of the word "RaNCh"

The station name, call letters, and phrases were developed by Joe Stanley (Stanley
Solutions Owner) in 2015 and have led the KRNC branding scheme since.
