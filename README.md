### Brief History
KRNC, a ficticious broadcast radio station is a radio station for everyone, it is
everyone's own station. "Your music lives here," the musical positioning statement
for the station.

The station call-letters (KRNC) are derived as follows:
 - K: The "West-Coast" signifier used by all radio stations west of the Mississippi River
 - RNC: The "prominent" and "leading" consonants of the word "RaNCh"

The station name, call letters, and phrases were developed by Joe Stanley (Stanley
Solutions Owner) in 2015 and have led the KRNC branding scheme since.
